# Squarefree Number Gaps

## Theorem (Erdős 1951)

Let $s_1 < s_2 < s_3 < \cdots$ be the sequence of squarefree numbers.

For any $0 \leq \alpha \leq 2$, the limit

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} \sum_{s_n \leq x} (s_{n+1} - s_n)^\alpha$$

exists.

## Requirements

- Prove existence of the limit, not just formalize the statement
- The proof should work for the range $0 \leq \alpha \leq 2$

## Proof Approach

Use the density of squarefree numbers ($6/\pi^2$) and moment bounds on gap distributions.
